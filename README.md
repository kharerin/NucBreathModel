The codes to generate the data and figures in the paper are provided below:

## Figure 1
To generate figure, run Figure_1_mnase200U.py. These data are stored in the folder yeastsc_lnZ/H4_Input_MNase_200U_Rep1 and generated using MNase data provided in GEO: ID GSE83123, dataset_H4_Input_MNase_200U Replicate_2. The pipeline for the analyses (extraction and refernce mapping) of the seqeuncing reads are provided in the paper associated with the same GEO ID.
